Welcome to the NitroTypeBot, a Python script that automates typing races on the [NitroType](https://www.nitrotype.com) website. This bot uses [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), a powerful web automation tool, to navigate the website, log in, and participate in typing races with lightning speed and accuracy.

## ‚ö° Features

- **Automated Login**: The script can log in to your NitroType account using your username and password.
- **Human-like Typing**: The bot simulates human-like typing behavior by introducing random delays between keystrokes, making it harder to detect.
- **Undetectable**: The script uses various techniques to make it undetectable, such as setting the user agent, enabling incognito mode, and disabling tracking.
- **Efficient**: The bot can type entire sentences with minimal delays, allowing you to achieve impressive typing speeds.
